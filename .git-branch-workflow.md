# Git Branch Workflow

## Branch Strategy

- **main**: Production-ready code (protected)
- **Development**: Active development branch
- **feature/***: Feature branches for new work

## Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout Development
git pull origin Development
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Make Changes
- Develop your feature
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Follow conventional commits format

### 3. Push Feature Branch
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 4. Create Pull Request
- Open PR from feature branch to Development
- Get code review if required
- Merge when approved

### 5. Merge to Development
After PR is merged to Development, delete the feature branch:
```bash
git checkout Development
git pull origin Development
git branch -d feature/your-feature-name
```

### 6. Promote Development to main
When Development is stable:
```bash
git checkout main
git merge Development
git push origin main
```

## Commit Message Format

Use conventional commits:
- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `test:` Test updates
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks
- `style:` Code style changes

## Best Practices

1. Always pull latest before creating new branches
2. Keep feature branches small and focused
3. Rebase your feature branch before merging
4. Never commit directly to main
5. Keep Development branch up to date
6. Use descriptive branch names

## Current Status

- Active branch: Development
- Stable branch: main
- Feature branches: Created as needed
